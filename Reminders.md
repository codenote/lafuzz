**_Read this before you use_**

# Reminders for all users: #

  1. Like my other prods, this script is **for users who have knowledge** on the field and application of computer security. Even though I break down and design the script to be friendly with new user; this doesn't mean it will help you completely solve the problem. As ones always say:_Tools don't make hackers but hackers make tools_.
  1. I do not hold the responsible for the damage you cause or will cause. I have written these tool for educational purposes. However since it is open source/free, I can't control/know either good or bad guy/gal will use them. Just think twice before you want to do something.
  1. You are free to modify, rip and share every line of codes while having a happy hacker life! `:)`
