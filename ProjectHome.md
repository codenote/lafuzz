LaFuzz is a LFI exploiter/fuzzer (there is RFI function but it's in early stage). The fuzzing script for custom/new exploits is also in beta.

UPDATE: I received emails from people stated that the fuzzer acts quirky. Noted and I am working on a fix right now. Many thanks to Ady Tech.

### Features: ###
  * Auto & Manual fuzz.
  * Fuzz automatically work with different circumstance.
  * Customizable input.
  * Auto dumping & saving (look for html files)
  * Several different techniques.
  * Friendly CLI
